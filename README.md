#   TDD pytest

## Objectives
the participants will learn:
- more practice on the usage of pytest
- Error types
    - no parameter passed to function
    - wrong parameter datatype 

## install pytest
    pip install pytest

## run test command
    python3 -m pytest tests

## code file text/tools.py
## test file tests/test_string/test_tools.py

## Usage: 
Learner must run the tests using the previous command and figure out why some tests passed and other not.
also should solve the questions and tasks that exist as comments on the code files.

## very important notice:
the code should be written in a way to be testable like break it down into functions instead of writing the code in a big bunch of one unit
